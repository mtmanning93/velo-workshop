# Velo Workshop

Velo Workshop aims to make getting a bike serviced or fixed a simpler task for the rider. By creating an online presence where the rider can be introduced and find Velo Workshop easily. In times of need, for example an emergency puncture, the rider can contact them directly via the contact information provided or simply follow the online map to the workshop. 

More specifically this platform provides the rider with a simple and easy way to book their bike in for service, choosing from 3 types. Leisure, Weekend Rider and Pro service options are given, detailling a breakdown in costs, duration of work and what can be expected from each service. By booking in ahead of time they can plan ahead, and ensure the level of service they want can be given.

## Site Goals/ Strategy

Velo Workshop is useful to the rider as they can find a nearby mechanic, book servicing ahead of time, speak to a professional and realise a community. It is useful to the owner as it helps market a service to the user, provide an overview of their qualifications and achievements creating a trust within the industry and reduse phone calls regarding servicing, leaving more time for mechanics.

The main section of the home page begins with a large image, followed by 4 informative sections. Each section has the same style, information on one side and some visual content on the other.

- Main Image

The main image is used to portray the workshop environment of Velo Workshop. The workshop is well stocked with tools and parts and has the tools cleanly placed in their correct spaces. The main mechanic in the image is smiling showing friendliness and pleasure in his work. The image was chosen as it provides the user with an insight into how the workshop is running. It is clean, but productive and the mechanics look to be interested and friendly. It is positioned so that the user immediately sees this when entering the site.
